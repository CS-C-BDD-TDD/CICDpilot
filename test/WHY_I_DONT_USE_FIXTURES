Because they don't work

I had three fixutres in three files:

indicators.yml

indicator_1:
  title: "Indicator Title"
  description: "Indicator Description"
  indicator_type: "Benign"
  stix_id: "NCCIC:indicator-1"

domains.yml

domain_1:
  name: "www.google.com"

observables.yml

observable_1:
  indicator: inddicator_1
  object: domain_1


It created the indicator and the observable, but did not create the domain.

Instead, I create the objects directly on the test.  This has the side benfit of putting all the information in front of you, instead of spread among files.
