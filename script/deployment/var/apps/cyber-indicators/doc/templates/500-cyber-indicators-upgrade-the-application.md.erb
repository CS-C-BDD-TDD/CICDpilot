**Install the new application.**

```bash
cd [PATH_TO_NEW_CYBER_INDICATORS_RPM]
yum -y install [NAME_OF_NEW_CYBER_INDICATORS_RPM]
```

**Initialize the application System Configuration.**

```bash
TNS_ADMIN=[TNS_ADMIN] /var/apps/cyber-indicators/bin/initialize-sysconfig
```

**Update the application database.**

```bash
RAILS_ENV=dbadmin /var/apps/cyber-indicators/bin/rake db:migrate
```

<%if ENV['IMPORTANT']%>
!Important! The RAILS_ENV should match the environment permitted to execute schema changes in the /etc/cyber-indicators/config/database.yml.  By default, this value is 'dbadmin'.

!Important! The RAILS_ENV can be assigned only two values "dbadmin" or "production".  Please refer to the example /etc/cyber-indicators/config/database.yml.
<%end%>

<%if ENV['EXAMPLE']%>
!Example!  /etc/cyber-indicators/config/database.yml:

```yaml
production:
  adapter: oracle_enhanced
  database: example_database
  username: example_username
  password: example_password
dbadmin:
  adapter: oracle_enhanced
  database: example_database
  username: example_username
  password: example_password
```
<%end%>

<%if ENV['NOTE']%>
!Note!  In this example, RAILS_ENV would be assigned "dbadmin", which corresponds to the "dbadmin" section identifier in this file.  The only section identifiers permitted for the Cyber Indicators application are "production" and "dbadmin".
<%end%>

**Grant application permissions.**

```bash
RAILS_ENV=dbadmin /var/apps/cyber-indicators/bin/rake db:grant
```
<%if ENV['IMPORTANT']%>

!Note!  In this example, RAILS_ENV would be assigned "dbadmin", which corresponds to the "dbadmin" section identifier in this file.  The only section identifiers permitted for the Cyber Indicators application are "production" and "dbadmin".
<%end%>

**Apply synonyms to the application user.**

```bash
/var/apps/cyber-indicators/bin/rake db:synonyms
```

<%if ENV['EXAMPLE']%>
!Example!  /etc/cyber-indicators/config/database.yml:

```yaml
production:
  adapter: oracle_enhanced
  database: example_database_name
  username: example_appuser_username
  password: example_appuser_password
dbadmin:
  adapter: oracle_enhanced
  database: example_database_name
  username: example_dbadmin_username
  password: example_dbadmin_password
```
<%end%>

<%if ENV['NOTE']%>

<%end%>

**Update the groups and permissions**

```bash
/var/apps/cyber-indicators/bin/rake groups:update
```

**If this is a CIR system, turn off SSO**

```bash
MODE=CIR /var/apps/cyber-indicators/sbin/set-username-and-password-authentication
```

**If this system is using ICAM authentication, change necessary settings**

```bash
/var/apps/cyber-indicators/sbin/set-icam-authentication
```

**Update settings.yml**

Update /etc/cyber-indicators/config/settings.yml with the information contained in Appendix I - Proper settings for each Server Type

**Start the application.**

```bash
service cyber-indicators start
```

<%if ENV['NOTE']%>
!Note! If in Active Directory mode, and previously working users start getting "You do not have an account on this system",

Run the following to fix and restat cyber indicators:

```bash
/var/apps/cyber-indicators/sbin/set-kerberos-authentication
service cyber-indicators restart
```
<%end%>

<%if ENV['TROUBLESHOOTING']%>
## [Troubleshooting] ORA-01882: timezone region not found in the localhost log.

The server operating system timezone configuration is incorrect.

```bash
mv /etc/localtime /etc/localtime.old
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime
```

!Note! You should replace your time zone with the correct time zone for your region.

Restart the application service.

```bash
service cyber-indicators restart
```
<%end%>

**Rebuild the SOLR Indexes (if necessary)**

```bash
/var/apps/cyber-indicators/bin/solr-reindex
```

!Note! On ECIS and CIR, this process will take less than 15 minutes.  On CIAP, this process will take several hours to complete.
