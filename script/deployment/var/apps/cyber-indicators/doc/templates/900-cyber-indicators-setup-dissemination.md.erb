# Setting up dissemination from ECIS to FLARE

## Via SFTP

Note: If you are attempting to set up dissemination via FLARE API, refer to the "Via API" section, below in this document.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following pieces of information:

  * The IP/Hostname of the FLARE server (where the disseminated files are going to be copied)
  * The directories that the disseminated files will be going to on the FLARE server
  * The name of the user which SFTP will be connecting to on the FLARE server
  * The password for the user which SFTP will be connecting to on the FLARE server

The following will need to be set up on the FLARE server:

  * The above user with the above password
  * The above user needs to have read and write access to the subdirectories of the FLAREclient on the FLARE server
  * The FLARE system needs to be set up to accept SFTP connections.

## Creating the SSH Key

Once you have the user set up properly on the FLARE server, with proper permissions to access the directories, follow the instructions below:

On the ECIS VM:

1. Log in, and sudo to root

2. Run ```ssh-keygen```
Hit enter 3 times

3. ```sftp <above username>@<FLARE server IP>```
Enter password for the account
```
cd .ssh
get authorized_keys
quit
```
NOTE: If authorized_keys does not exist, that is fine.

4. ```
vi authorized_keys
:r ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
:wq
```

5. ```sftp <above username>@<FLARE server IP>```
Enter password for the account
```
cd .ssh
put authorized_keys
quit
```

6. ```sftp <above username>@<FLARE server IP>```
You should NOT be prompted for the password
```quit```

At this point, the SFTP connection should be set up properly.

## Create disseminate.yml file

The /etc/cyber-indicators/config/disseminate.yml file should contain the following (```<IP or hostname for FLARE server>``` and ```<above username>``` will need to be replaced with the proper values)

```
#ECIS Information
#FLARE Server
FLARE_SERVER: <IP or hostname for FLARE server>
FLARE_SERVER_USERNAME: <above username>
# API URI information - For https://relayout:1234/publish?collection=<feed>
#     you would use https://relayout:1234/publish
#     Do not put ?collection=<feed>
FLARE_API_URI: https://localhost:3000/cyber-indicators/uploads?overwrite=Y
# MODE is one of SFTP, API, BOTH
MODE: SFTP
```

## Create disseminate_feeds.yml file

The /etc/cyber-indicators/config/disseminate_feeds.yml file should contain the following (both ```<proper directory...>``` will need to be replaced with the proper values)

```
FEDGOV:
    profile:    ISA
    government: Y
    directory:  <proper directory for FEDGOV feed -- get from FLARE team>
    feed:       #not needed
    active:     true
AIS:
    profile:    AIS
    government: N
    directory:  <proper directory for AIS feed -- get from FLARE team>
    feed:       #not needed
    active:     true
CISCP:
    profile:    CISCP
    government: Y
    directory:  <proper directory for CISCP feed -- get from FLARE team>
    feed:       #not needed
    active:     false
SANITIZED_MAPPINGS:
    directory:  <proper directory for SANITIZED_MAPPINGS -- get from FLARE team>
    feed:       #not needed
    active:     false
```

Continue with the "Set up cron task" section, below.

## Via API

## Prerequisites

You will need the following pieces of information:

  * The URI of the API on the FLARE server (where the disseminated files are going to be copied)
  * The names of the feeds which the disseminated files will be going to on the FLARE server

## Create disseminate.yml file

The /etc/cyber-indicators/config/disseminate.yml file should contain the following (```<API>``` will need to be replaced with the proper value)

```
#ECIS Information
#FLARE Server
FLARE_SERVER: #not needed
FLARE_SERVER_USERNAME: #not needed
# API URI information - For https://relayout:1234/publish?collection=<feed>
#     you would use https://relayout:1234/publish
#     Do not put ?collection=<feed>
FLARE_API_URI: <<API>>
# MODE is one of SFTP, API, BOTH
MODE: API
```

## Create disseminate_feeds.yml file

The /etc/cyber-indicators/config/disseminate_feeds.yml file should contain the following (both ```<proper directory...>``` will need to be replaced with the proper values)

```
FEDGOV:
    profile:    ISA
    government: Y
    directory:  #not needed
    feed:       <proper name for FEDGOV feed -- get from FLARE team>
    active:     true
AIS:
    profile:    AIS
    government: N
    directory:  #not needed
    feed:       <proper name for AIS feed -- get from FLARE team>
    active:     true
CISCP:
    profile:    CISCP
    government: Y
    directory:  #not needed
    feed:       CISCP
    active:     false
SANITIZED_MAPPINGS:
    directory:  #not needed
    feed:       JSON
    active:     false
```

## Set up cron task

Lastly, a cron job needs to be set up.  Add this to the root user's crontab file:

```*/10 * * * * /var/apps/cyber-indicators/bin/run_dissemination```
