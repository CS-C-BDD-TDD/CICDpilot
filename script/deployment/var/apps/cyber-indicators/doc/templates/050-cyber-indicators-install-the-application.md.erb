# Install the Application

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have:

* Installed Java
* Installed the Oracle client libraries.
* Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable.
* Set the ORACLE_HOME, TNS_ADMIN and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables.
* Set the system PATH environment variable to include the ORACLE_HOME bin path.

## Install the STIG-hardened Tomcat package.

**Install the RPM.**

```bash
cd [PATH_TO_TOMCAT_7_RPM]
yum -y install [NAME_OF_TOMCAT_7_RPM]
```

<%if ENV['NOTE']%>
!Note! The Yum package manager can install local files in addition to files located in a Yum repository.  As an alternative, you may also use the "rpm" command to install the software.
<%end%>

## Install the Cyber Indicators package

**Install the RPM.**

```bash
cd [PATH_TO_CYBER_INDICATORS_RPM]
yum -y install [NAME_OF_CYBER_INDICATORS_RPM]
```

<%if ENV['IMPORTANT']%>
!Important!  This RPM depends on a STIG-hardened version of Tomcat.
<%end%>

<%if ENV['NOTE']%>
!Note! The Yum package manager can install local files in addition to files located in a Yum repository.  As an alternative, you may also use the "rpm" command to install the software.
<%end%>

**Link the Web Application Folders**

```bash
/var/apps/cyber-indicators/bin/link-tomcat7
```

<%if ENV['NOTE']%>
!Note! This command does not produce any output.

!Note! You can verify that this command worked by viewing the newly created /usr/share/tomcat7 directory.
<%end%>

**Initialize the application web server.**

```bash
/var/apps/cyber-indicators/bin/initialize-application-webserver
```

<%if ENV['TROUBLESHOOTING']%>
## [Troubleshooting] Manually execute the rake task.
```bash
TEMPLATE=/etc/cyber-indicators/templates/etc/cyber-indicators/tomcat7/conf/server.xml.erb \
OUTFILE=/usr/share/tomcat7/conf/server.xml /var/apps/cyber-indicators/bin/rake \
db:template:create;
```
<%end%>

**Initialize the application System Configuration.**

```bash
TNS_ADMIN=[TNS_ADMIN] /var/apps/cyber-indicators/bin/initialize-sysconfig
```

**Initialize the application settings.**

```bash
/var/apps/cyber-indicators/bin/initialize-system-settings
```

<%if ENV['TROUBLESHOOTING']%>
## [Troubleshooting] Manually execute the rake task.
```bash
TEMPLATE=/etc/cyber-indicators/templates/etc/sysconfig/cyber-indiators.erb \
OUTFILE=/etc/sysconfig/cyber-indicators \
/var/apps/cyber-indicators/bin/rake db:template:create;
```
<%end%>

<%if ENV['TROUBLESHOOTING']%>
**Review the System Configuration.**

Edit the application system configuration file.

```bash
/etc/sysconfig/cyber-indicators
```

**Review the default environment variables.**

```bash
# TNS_ADMIN: Specifies the location of the Oracle tnsnames.ora file.
TNS_ADMIN=/etc

# JAVA_OPTS: Specifies the memory used by Java
JAVA_OPTS="-XX:PermSize=512m -XX:MaxPermSize=1024m"

# NLS_LANG: Specifies the character set for your connection to Oracle.
NLS_LANG=AMERICAN_AMERICA.UTF8

# SSL Certificate File:  Location for the server trusted certs.
SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem

# SOLR URL: The URL that the application uses to connect to theG search engine.
SOLR_URL=https://localhost:8983/solr/production

# CYBER_INDICATORS_HOME: Cyber indicators application root path
CYBER_INDICATORS_HOME=/var/apps/cyber-indicators
```
<%end%>

<%if ENV['IMPORTANT']%>
!Important! Replace the TNS_ADMIN value with the root path to your Oracle TNS configuration file.
<%end%>

<%if ENV['EXAMPLE']%>
!Example! Setting the TNS_ADMIN environment variable.

If your Oracle TNS configuration file is located here:

```bash
/etc/tnsnames.ora
```

Then the TNS_ADMIN environment variable should be set to:

```bash
TNS_ADMIN=/etc
```
<%end%>
