The transfer.yml file contains the following information:

	log_file:          The full path to a logging file
	remote_user:       The username on the remote system that will be used to transfer the files

	email_to:          Comma separated list of addresses to send the email to
	email_message:     The one-line body of the email

The email_message can contain the following which will be replaced by their proper values:

	%time%      - the current time
	%directory% - the directory the files are copied to
	%hostname%  - the hostname where the files are copied to
